| Test Case ID | Test Case Title | Prerequisites | Test Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

Fill in "Name (English)", "ID Type", and "ID Number".<br>3. Attempt to save. | The client should be created successfully. | **Failed.** The system required "First Name Arabic" and "Nationality" as mandatory fields, which contradicts the PRD.

| **CDM-TC-003**| Verify successful bulk client upload. | User is logged in. | 1. Create a CSV with 2 valid, unique clients, including one with 'Iqama' ID.<br>2.

Arabic names for the other client were corrupted (**Bug-003**). | **Fail** |
| **CDM-TC-004**| Verify bulk upload respects the 10-client limit. | User is logged in. | 1. Create a CSV with 11 client records.<br>2. Upload the file. | The upload should be rejected and a clear error message displayed. | **Failed.** The system partially processed the file, uploading the first 10 clients and silently ignoring the 11th. See **Bug-004** & **Bug-005**. | **Fail** |
| **CDM-TC-005**| Verify client list can be sorted and filtered. | Multiple clients exist. | 1. Navigate to the client list.<br>2. Use the search bar to find a client by name.<br>3. Use the sort options. | Search should return the correct client. Sorting should reorder the list. | The features are present. Search works. Sorting has a usability flaw where it allows sorting on a hidden data column. See **Bug-006**. | **Pass** |
